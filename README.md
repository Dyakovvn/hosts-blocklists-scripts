# hosts-blocklist-scripts
If you are looking for dnsmasq compatible hostname and domain name filters, you should go [here](https://github.com/notracking/hosts-blocklists).

This repository is for the scripts used to generate the [notracking hosts-blocklists](https://github.com/notracking/hosts-blocklists). At this point in time it only contains the whitelist, the rest will be available sometime in the future.
